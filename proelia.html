                Each player takes all the regiment cards of their color and chooses in secret six regiments that will make up their army, subject to the following restraints:

                From each of their three piles, each player chooses one order to keep for themselves and one order to discard. Once this is done, the players exchange their resulting piles of two. From each of their new piles, players choose one order to keep and then discard the remaining one. All discarded orders are set aside and will not be used in this game.

                Taking your turn:

                    Choose up to two regiment cards from the 'maintaining' sections on your order grid and set them aside. These will be the regiments you give orders to this turn.

                  <li>
                    Move all regiment cards that are readying to instead be maintaining the orders that they last carried out.

                  <li>
                    Swap one of the three order cards with an order from your hand if desired. If you do, move all regiment cards that were maintaining the swapped order to be maintaining 'awaiting orders' instead.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Move the two regiment cards that you set aside to be above two order cards of your choice, in the 'readying' section; those regiments then carry out their respective orders.
                    <ul><li>Regiments are not allowed to share the same order card as another regiment, though two regiments may seperately be given identical orders from two identical order cards.</li></ul>

                Carrying out orders:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    When a regiment carries out an order, it may perform each action marked with a üîº that is on the order card. The actions on the order card that are performed must be performed from top to bottom.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    All rules marked with a üîº on the order are in effect during the entire turn in which it is carrying out that order, and then cease to take effect once that player's turn is over.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    When a regiment is done carrying out its order, it is considered to be 'readying'. This is represented by being in a 'readying' section on the order grid, which effectively prohibits them from being chosen for another order on the next turn.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

                Maintaining orders:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    When a regiment is in a 'maintaining' section of the order grid, it is considered to be maintaining the order that is above it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Rules marked with a üîÑ are in effect while a regiment is carrying out that order, readying after having carried out that order, or maintaining that order.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Rules marked with a ‚è≥ are worded to be optional actions. When a player decides to have a regiment take such an action, that regiment is moved to be maintaining 'awaiting orders' as soon as it completes the described action.
                  </li>
                </ul>

              <li>
                Each bonus it has to its move from its order and/or regiment type allows it to move across one more node connection when it moves. It is still all considered to be one move (e.g. a knight regiment, with 'move+', may move across two node connections with its move).
                <ul><li>Bonuses are marked with a '+' after the word 'move', as in the example above.</li></ul>

                When a regiment can fight at range, it can fight with a regiment without having to move into that regiment's node. Instead, the regiment fighting at range may fight with any regiment that is no more node connections away than its range value.

                    The regiment that is choosing to fight at range is considered to be the attacker.

                    When an attacking regiment fights at range, it does not get routed for losing.

                If multiple regiments survive a fight, the defender stays in the node and the others must move to any empty and adjacent node that they could have reached with their original move. If no such node exists, they are routed.
