                Each player takes all the regiment cards of their color and chooses in secret six regiments that will make up their army, subject to the following restraints:

                Shuffle the remaining common orders (there should be one of each) together with the type-based orders, and then divide that deck into piles of four. Give each player three of the piles and set the remaining pile aside.

                From each of their three piles, each player chooses one order to keep for themselves and one order to discard. Once this is done, the players exchange their resulting piles of two and then again choose one order from each to keep and then discard the remaining one. All discarded orders are set aside and will not be used in this game.

                Players take turns placing their regiment tokens one at a time within the rally zone on their side of the board. Rally zones are the interconnected group of nodes filled in with grey.

                When an order says to move, the regiment carrying out the order may move to any node connected to its current node (an adjacent node). Each bonus move point it has allows it to move across one more node connection with its move, but it is still all considered one move (e.g. a knight regiment, with +1 move, may move across two node connections with its move).
              </li>
              <li>
                If a regiment enters a forest or a shallows node, its move immediately ends, regardless of how many bonus move points it has.
              </li>
              <li>
                Regiments cannot move into the same node as another regiment except to fight.

                Fighting is carried out after all the orders. A fight happens between regiments when an order with a green circle around its fight value causes the regiment carrying out the order to move into a node with an enemy regiment.
              </li>
              <li>
                When regiments fight, use the fight scores of the two regiments (defined on the order card and modified by other rules) and the chart below to see who wins. The losing regiment is routed - remove it from the game.

                  <li>
                    Attackerâ€™s fight score is 1 or more higher: attacker wins

              </li>
              <li>
                A regiment that can fight at range can fight with any regiment within its range when its order has a green circle around its fight value. A regiment is in range if it is no more node connections away than the regimentâ€™s range value.
                <ul><li>When an attacking regiment fights at range, it does not get routed for losing.</li></ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                If multiple regiments are fighting a single enemy, they each get +1 fight for each other allied regiment involved. Otherwise, the fights are carried out individually as normal. If multiple allied regiments survive the fight, choose one to stay in the node and move the others to any adjacent node. This may result in additional fights (as the regiment breaks through the battle line).
