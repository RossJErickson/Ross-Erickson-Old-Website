    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="">The two levels I designed can be found via "Levels", "User Levels", and then searching by author "Erickson_9431". </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        The game has a somewhat hard learning curve, so if you choose to play the levels yourself, they will feel much more difficult without previous experience. There are also recordings of other (very highly skilled) people beating the levels if you do not wish to try it yourself.
