    <h1>The Lost Age</h1>
    <p>Due to being made much earlier than the other games in my portfolio, The Lost Age is in a fully paper-based prototype format. Work is being done to convert it to a more friendly-appearing online format, however, for the time being the original is linked below.</p>

    <p>Notes</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Converting the files to PDF format for consistency resulted in slight changes to the dimensions of certain objects. For example, some of the circular tokens appear as ovals. Please disregard such minor discrepancies.

      <li>
        The region board was made in pieces in order to both fit them onto individual pages and to allow for easier transportation in a hypothetical board game box. The "Mock-up of Board Setup" file is intended to show the assembled region board.

        This game is in its prototype stage; as such, I made pictures, font, and backgrounds by using either placeholder text or the basic graphic design options offered by Microsoft Office. These are not representative of an intended final version.
